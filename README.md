# Algotrading-Developing algorithms in Quantconnect and Submitting Alpha
## Fintech 5 : Final Project 2nd Aug-14Nov 2021
## Project Report by Lim Chye Joo (t0921038)

**OVERVIEW**
To design and develop an intelligent systematic trading system leveraging the fundamentals of
investing and algotrading.

**SKILLS**: Python, Understanding of libraries and Quantconnect

**Phase 1**: Foundation (2 weeks)

**A :Fundamentals of Python**
The project will be developed in python and hence the first part will be to understand python.
Getting familiarized with how to use notebooks or any python IDE for:
- Loading data
- Cleaning data
- Using Libraries, numpy and pandas and Yahoo Finance
- Creating Indicators (Technical, Fundamental ) by libraries and raw python
- Visualising data
We will use google colab
Documentation of steps
***Deliverable*: A python script which inputs a dataframe and outputs all the important financial
parameters like BASS and other indicators**

**B: Fundamentals of Quantconnect**
Quantconnect is a very vast tool for developing trading algorithms. First phase is to complete all
the botcamps within quantconnect to get familiar with syntax and functions of QC
- Understanding of Quant Connects Alpha stream
***Deliverable*:Successfully completed all the bootcamps**
